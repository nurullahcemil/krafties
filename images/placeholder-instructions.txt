App Icon Placeholder Instructions

This directory should contain your iPhone app icons. For best results:

1. Use PNG format with transparency
2. Recommended size: 1024x1024 pixels (will be displayed smaller on the website)
3. Follow Apple's icon design guidelines:
   - Simple, recognizable design
   - Avoid transparency in the actual icon design
   - Use a square icon with rounded corners (the website styling will add the iOS-style rounding)

For placeholder purposes, you should add:
- app1.png
- app2.png

You can create these using any image editing software like Photoshop, Sketch, Figma, or even use free tools like Canva.

When ready to launch your site, replace these placeholders with your actual app icons.
